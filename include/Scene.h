 * A scene is a "place where action occurs." It can be a title screen, a loading screen, 
 * a cut-scene, or an entire world in which players, actors, and other objects interact. 
 *
 * At a technical level, a scene loads and manages all objects that exist in a scene. It
 * processes or passes on user inputs to the relevant objects, and performs any simulation,
 * Artificial Intelligence (AI) calculations, etc., that are needed to display the scene.
 * Scenes can also have audio.
 *
 * Child classes can set the playerAvatar, which is the object that user input will be 
 * forwarded, unless the command methods (e.g., goRight()) are overridden.
